# Introduction ⚒  
Doctor Bot is a medical assistant app used to diagnose various diseases, suggest medicines and to save your report history. The app work on various types of high level Machine Learning model. The machine Learning model learns the input image and shows you result. The app consists of an medical bot which guides you medicine according to the symptoms you have. Even you can add your report history which get saved on a custom database.

# Inspiration ❤️
The idea behind construction of this app was to remove mental pressure of people when they get affected by diseases. During this pandemic when people are not able to visit hospitals frequently they can use this app to identify what diseases are they affected from. The app provides 89% accurate result. The app even provides medicinal suggestions according to the symptoms you have. During this hight time when people fear to go hospitals, they can have the same guidance and suggestions being at home using Doctor Bot . 

So our idea was to create an app which provides 100% guidance and suggestions to a patient regardless of going to the hospital.
